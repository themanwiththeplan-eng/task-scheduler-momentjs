# Task Scheduler App

---

## The Reason for Building The App

The reason that I built this app was to gain familiarity with third party api's including but not limited to, bootstrap, jquery and moment.js.
I found that although a little strange compared to working with vanilla js, JQuery was actually quite easy to work with and pretty developer friendly.
I also found that when building this application their are niche things in JQuery that make it easier than using vanilla js. (i.e, using .each rather than using a 
for loop)
